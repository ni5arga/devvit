# Pixelary

A competitive async MMO pixel drawing and guessing game built on the Reddit Developer Platform.

This app demonstrates how to:

* Use Reddit Blocks to create an interactive post (i.e. a canvas with a clickable color pallate that can be used to draw).

* Use Redis to create a leaderboard.

* Use Devvit forms to capture user input (in this case, guesses as to what the picture is).

* Use useInterval to crete a countdown timer.

* Use assets like GIFs within an interactive post.

## Prerequisites

Pixelary relies on post flairs. Please enable post flair in mod tools before you install the game.
