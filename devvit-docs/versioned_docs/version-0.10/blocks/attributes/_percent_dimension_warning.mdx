Note: A block and it's children will not be rendered if the relative (percentage) dimension is invalid.

A relative {props.dimension} is valid if it meets one of the following rules:
   - Parent block must have the {props.dimension} defined.
   - Parent block must be stretching {(props.dimension == "width") && (widthStretch)}{(props.dimension != "width") && (heightStretch)}.
     - Refer to [alignment](../blocks/stacks#alignment) to understand when content will stretch.
   - Parent block must be growing {(props.dimension == "width") && (widthGrow)}{(props.dimension != "width") && (heightGrow)}.
     - Refer to [grow](../blocks/stacks#grow) to understand when content will grow.
