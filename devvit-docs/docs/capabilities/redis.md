# Redis

You can add a database to your app to store and retrieve data. The Redis plugin is designed to be fast, scalable, and secure. It supports a subset of the full Redis API, including:

- [Transactions](#transactions) for things like counting votes atomically in polls
- [String operations](#strings) for batch writing or incrementing numbers
- [Sorted sets](#sorted-set) for creating leaderboards
- [Hashes](#hash) for managing a collection of key-value pairs

Each app version installed on a subreddit is namespaced, which means Redis data is siloed from other subreddits. Keep in mind that there wonâ€™t be a single source of truth for all installations of your app, since each app installation can only access the data that it has stored in the Redis database.

## Limits and Quotas

- Max commands per second: 1000
- Max request size: 5 MB
- Max storage: 500 MB

All limits are applied at a per-installation granularity.

## Add Redis to your app

When creating an app, enable the plugin in `Devvit.configure`.

```tsx
Devvit.configure({
  redis: true,
});
```

## Examples

### Menu items

```tsx
Devvit.addMenuItem({
  location: 'subreddit',
  label: 'Test Redis',
  onPress: async (event, { redis }) => {
    const key = 'hello';
    await redis.set(key, 'world');
    const value = await redis.get(key);
    console.log(`${key}: ${value}`);
  },
});
```

### Experience posts

You can follow this template to create an experience post containing an interactive progress bar backed by Redis.

```tsx
// start from a template
devvit new <replace-with-your-app-name> --template=redis
devvit playtest <your-test-subreddit>
```

### Hash

Redis hashes can store up to ~ 4.2 billion key-value pairs. We recommend using hash for managing collections of key-value pairs whenever possible and iterating over it using a combination of `hscan`, `hkeys` and `hgetall`.

| [expireTime](https://redis.io/commands/expiretime/) | Returns the absolute Unix timestamp (since January 1, 1970) in seconds at which the given key will expire. |

### [Transactions](https://redis.io/topics/transactions)

Redis transactions allow a group of commands to be executed in a single isolated step. For example, to implement voting action in a polls app, these three actions need to happen together:

- Store the selected option for the user.
- Increment the count for selected option.
- Add the user to voted user list.

You can sequence all of the above steps in a single transaction using `multi` and `exec` to ensure that either all of the steps happen together or none at all.

| **Command**                                   | **Action**                                                                                            |

| [exec](https://redis.io/commands/exec/)       | Executes all previously queued commands in a transaction and restores the connection state to normal. |
| [discard](https://redis.io/commands/discard/) | Flushes all previously queued commands in a transaction and restores the connection state to normal.  |
| [watch](https://redis.io/commands/watch/)     | Marks the given keys to be watched for conditional execution of a transaction.                        |
| [unwatch](https://redis.io/commands/unwatch/) | Flushes all the previously watched keys for a transaction.                                            |
